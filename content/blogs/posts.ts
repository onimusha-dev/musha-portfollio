I'm going to be honest with you: most of my side projects don't *need* Rust. A Python script would've done the job in a quarter of the time. But I still reach for Rust — and here's why that's not as irrational as it sounds.

## The Ownership Model Changes How You Think

The borrow checker is famously brutal to beginners. I spent three weeks fighting it before I had my first "aha" moment. But once it clicks, something strange happens: you start *thinking differently* about code even in other languages.

When I write Python now, I'm mentally annotating lifetimes. When I write TypeScript, I notice when I'm mutating shared state carelessly. Rust didn't just teach me Rust — it made me a better programmer in every language I touch.

\`\`\`rust
fn process(data: &Vec<String>) -> Vec<String> {
    data.iter()
        .filter(|s| !s.is_empty())
        .map(|s| s.to_uppercase())
        .collect()
}
\`\`\`

No hidden copies. No surprise mutations. The compiler enforces your intent.

## The Error Messages Are Actually Good

This sounds like a trivial thing to praise, but Rust's error messages are *insanely* good. They don't just tell you what went wrong — they explain *why* and suggest a fix. Half the time the fix is exactly right.

Compare that to a segfault at runtime (C), a confusing traceback (Python), or "Cannot read properties of undefined" (JavaScript). Rust catches these at compile time and explains them clearly.

## The Performance Ceiling Is Real

I built a log parser for a side project. The Python version took ~8 seconds on a 500MB log file. The Rust version: 0.4 seconds. Same algorithm, just compiled.

For a CLI tool or a small server that's under constant load, that difference isn't academic — it's the difference between a tool people actually use and one they abandon.

## When I Don't Use Rust

To be fair: I don't use Rust for everything.

- **CRUD apps?** Next.js or a simple Node backend.
- **Quick data analysis?** Python every time.
- **Prototyping a new idea?** TypeScript — I need to iterate fast.

Rust is the right tool when performance matters, when you're building something that has to run reliably without babysitting, or when you just want to write something that feels *crafted*.

## The Community Keeps Me Coming Back

The Rust community is genuinely one of the best I've encountered in open source. Questions are answered thoughtfully, crates are well-documented, and the RFC process means language changes are deliberate and explained.

If you haven't tried Rust yet, you don't have to use it for something serious. Build a CLI tool. Write a simple file sorter. Fight the borrow checker for a weekend. You'll come out the other side a better programmer regardless of whether you ever ship Rust in production.

        "I've shipped production systems with both. Here's when each one is actually the right choice — and when you'll regret picking the wrong one.",

    content: `# PostgreSQL vs MongoDB: What Two Years of Pain Taught Me

I've heard the debate a thousand times: *"just use Postgres"* vs *"Mongo scales better"*. Both camps are wrong in interesting ways. After running both in production (sometimes at the same time, which is its own kind of pain), here's my honest take.

## The Real Difference Isn't Documents vs Tables

People frame this as a philosophical debate about data modeling. It's not. The real difference is **when your schema becomes clear to you**.

- **Postgres**: Your schema is defined upfront. It's rigid. This is a feature, not a bug — it forces you to think about your data model before you've painted yourself into a corner.
- **MongoDB**: Your schema is enforced by the application. This feels flexible until you have six versions of the same field name in production and no idea which documents have which shape.

## Where Mongo Actually Wins

I'm not here to bash MongoDB. There are real scenarios where it's the better choice:

**1. Truly variable schemas.** If you're storing user-uploaded form data where every form has different fields, document storage is genuinely natural.

**2. High write throughput on denormalized data.** MongoDB's write performance on a single collection with no joins can be faster because there's nothing to lock.

**3. Rapid early iteration.** When you're in the "I don't know what my data looks like yet" phase, Mongo's flexibility lets you move fast.

\`\`\`json
{
  "_id": "abc123",
  "type": "user_action",
  "payload": {
    "action": "click",
    "element": "#cta-button",
    "timestamp": 1706000000
  }
}
\`\`\`

That kind of heterogeneous event data is genuinely comfortable in Mongo.

## Where Postgres Wins (Most of the Time)

**1. Joins exist for a reason.** The moment you need data from two collections in MongoDB, you're either denormalizing everything (duplicating data, consistency nightmare) or using \`$lookup\` (which is just a worse JOIN).

**2. Transactions are real.** Mongo added multi-document transactions, but they're slower and more complex to use than Postgres transactions.

**3. The query planner is genius.** Postgres's query planner has been refined for decades. I've seen it rewrite a query I wrote badly into something optimal I wouldn't have thought of.

**4. JSON support.** Here's the kicker: Postgres has \`jsonb\` columns. You can store documents *inside* a relational database and query them with operators. It's the best of both worlds when you need it.

\`\`\`sql
SELECT user_id, metadata->>'plan' as plan
FROM users
WHERE metadata @> '{"verified": true}'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
\`\`\`

## My Actual Decision Framework

| Situation | My Choice |
|---|---|
| Standard web app with relations | Postgres |
| Event/log ingestion pipeline | Mongo (or ClickHouse) |
| Don't know schema yet | Start Postgres, migrate later |
| Geospatial queries | Postgres (PostGIS) |
| Full-text search is primary concern | Postgres (or Elasticsearch) |
| Need to move fast, schema unclear | Mongo, with the explicit plan to revisit |

## The Lesson

Most "Mongo vs Postgres" debates are really "I'm making a decision I can't easily reverse and I'm scared." Pick Postgres by default. If you hit a genuine need for document storage, you'll know it — it won't be a guess.

        "No CS degree. No bootcamp. Here's the actual path I took, what worked, what was a complete waste of time, and what I'd do differently.",

    content: `# Self-Taught to Intern: What Actually Helped

I started learning to code at 17 with a YouTube tutorial on HTML. Two years later I landed my first backend internship. No degree, no bootcamp, no connections. Here's an honest account of what actually moved the needle.

## What I Got Wrong First

The first 6 months I basically just watched tutorials. I'd watch someone build a to-do app, feel like I understood it, then try to build something and freeze completely.

**Tutorial hell is real.** You feel productive but you're not learning — you're pattern-matching. The moment you have to make a decision the tutorial didn't cover, you're stuck.

## The Shift That Changed Everything

I stopped asking "what should I learn?" and started asking "what do I want to build?"

I wanted to build a Discord bot for my friend group. So I learned Node.js to build it. I wanted to store settings across restarts, so I learned SQLite. The bot got slow, so I learned basic caching. The bot had downtime, so I learned how to run it on a cheap VPS and keep it alive with \`pm2\`.

That one project taught me more than 6 months of tutorials. And at the end I had something *real* I had built and used every day.

## What I'd Actually Recommend

**1. Build things that itch you.** Not tutorial projects. Things you actually want to exist. The motivation difference is enormous.

**2. Read code obsessively.** Pick a library you use. Open its source on GitHub. Start from the entry point and follow the breadcrumbs. This is how you learn what "good code" looks like.

**3. Solve real problems on the internet.** Find an open GitHub issue in a project you use. Even just reading the discussion teaches you how engineers think. When you can close one, do it.

**4. Write about what you learn.** Not for an audience — for yourself. Explaining something forces you to understand it. I kept a private Notion doc of things I learned each week. Reviewing it months later was like finding buried treasure.

**5. Get early feedback.** Share your code with someone more experienced, even in a Discord server. One critical code review taught me more about clean code than two months of reading books.

## On the Internship Application

When I applied, my GitHub had maybe 15 projects. Most were small. But they were *real* — things I actually built for a reason, not "Todo App Tutorial CRUD".

In my interview, they asked me to walk through a project I was proud of. I talked about the Discord bot and the problems I'd solved. They didn't care that I didn't have a degree. They cared that I could think through a problem and had actually shipped something.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

There's no shortcut. The self-taught path takes longer than a CS degree in some ways, and shorter in others. You'll spend a lot of time feeling lost and stupid. That feeling is the learning.

The people who make it are not the ones who are naturally talented — they're the ones who kept building things when it felt pointless. Keep building.
